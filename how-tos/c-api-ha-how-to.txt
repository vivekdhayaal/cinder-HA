Acquire two nodes, one to act as MASTER and the other as Backup.

Keepalived Master node:
1)add "net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1" to /etc/sysctl.conf
2)sudo sysctl -p
3)sudo apt-get install keepalived
4)create /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf filling up the variables with values in the template available @
  https://github.com/vivekdhayaal/cinder-HA/blob/master/keepalived/keepalived.conf
5)sudo update-rc.d keepalived defaults
6)sudo service keepalived start

Keepalived Backup node:
1)Repeat the same four steps
2)Set the below values in keepalived.conf
  * state BACKUP
  * virtual_router_id <unique number for a keepalived cluster>
  * priority <number less than priority of MASTER>.

Haproxy Master node:
1)sudo apt-get install haproxy
2)set "ENABLED=1" in /etc/default/haproxy
3)modify /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg with the configuration shown @
  https://github.com/vivekdhayaal/cinder-HA/blob/master/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
4)sudo update-rc.d haproxy defaults
5)sudo service haproxy start


Haproxy Backup node:
1)Repeat the same five steps

Cinder MASTER node:
1)Setup devstack with cinder services alone

Cinder Backup node:
1)Setup devstack with cinder services alone
2)Stop all services
3)Specify master node IP in "auth_uri", "auth_url", "connection", "rabbit_hosts", "glance_api_servers" params in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
4)Start c-api service alone.


Scale-out:
1)Add new node with c-api service alone running(as mentioned earlier).
2)Add the new node details to MASTER node haproxy.cfg and restart haproxy
3)Add the new node details to BACKUP node haproxy.cfg and restart haproxy
