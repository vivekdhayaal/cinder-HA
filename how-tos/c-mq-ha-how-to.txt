Acquire two nodes.


Cinder FIRST node:
1)Setup devstack with cinder services alone
2)Stop all services
3)Remove the section "[oslo_messaging_rabbit]" from cinder.conf
4)sudo apt-get install libzmq3
5)sudo pip install pyzmq (OR) sudo apt-get install python-zmq
6)Add to /etc/cinder/cinder.conf and /etc/oslo/matchmaker_ring.json the configurations specified @
  https://github.com/vivekdhayaal/cinder-HA/blob/master/zeromq/cinder.conf
  https://github.com/vivekdhayaal/cinder-HA/blob/master/zeromq/matchmaker_ring.json
7)Set the ownership of "/var/run/cinder" directory to cinder service process owner
8)/usr/local/bin/oslo-messaging-zmq-receiver --config-file /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
9)Start all services


Cinder NEXT node:
1)Repeat steps 1 to 8 as done for cinder first node.
2)Specify first node IP in "auth_uri", "auth_url", "connection", "glance_api_servers" params in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
3)Start c-api & c-sch services alone.


Scale-out:
1)Add new nodes with c-api & c-sch services alone running(as mentioned under section "cinder NEXT node")
2)Add these node information in matchmaker_ring.json in all the nodes in the cluster
3)Restart all cinder services in a phased manner.
